Multi-chain systems are a significant innovation, which provide greater scalability, customizability, and independence. At the core of multi-chain systems is the ability to run multiple blockchains simultaneously. Each blockchain is optimized for specialized use cases, thereby boosting the network's overall performance.

## Avalanche and Subnets

A Subnet is a network with its own set of rules regarding membership, token economics, and execution layer. It is composed of a Subset of Avalanche validators collaborating to achieve consensus on the state of one or more blockchains.

Each blockchain belongs to exactly one Subnet, but a Subnet can validate many blockchains. Each blockchain can define its own Virtual Machine (EVM, customized EVM or entirely new VM). Validators can be members of numerous Subnets.

Avalanche enables multiple interconnected Subnets. Each Subnet is independent while maintaining the capacity to communicate with other Subnets. Each validator can be part of multiple Subnets. All validators are part of the Subnet known as the Primary Network.

Solving the limitations of traditional blockchains, Avalanche Subnets arose largely from the need for validators to comply with requirements like Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures, specific licenses, geolocation restrictions, and unique hardware requirements, among others.

The tailored, application-specific blockchains of Subnets offer a solution to these challenges and many others, moving away from the monolithic blockchain structure of the past.
