Now that we've gone over what a Subnet is and what the benefits of creating a Subnet on Avalanche are, you are probably eager to test out the functionality of Subnets by creating one yourself!

AvaCloud is an online service that allows users to customize and launch their own Subnet just using the browser! No need to use any CLI or install any tools locally.

Furthermore, this is great news for us because we can just jump straight into deploying a Subnet and connecting to it!
