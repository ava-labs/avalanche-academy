In this course, you will learn how to transfer assets across multiple Avalanche blockchains with Avalanche Interchain Token Transfer ICTT.

## Why Take This Course?

A significant innovation in blockchain is the development of multi-chain systems, like Avalanche, which provide a significant improvement in scalability, interoperability, and flexibility. At the core of these multi-chain systems is the ability to run multiple blockchains that communicate. Each chain's VM is optimized for specialized use cases, thereby boosting the network's overall performance.

Cross-chain communication is a crucial building block of multi-chain systems. Utilizing Avalanche Interchain Messaging and Interchain Token Transfer is an incredibly easy way to build cross-Avalanche L1 dApps, since developers can build on top of an extensive, audited development framework. 

## Course Content

### Interoperability 

In the first section, we cover some basic concepts of interoperability in multi-chain systems. You will learn about examples of interoperability between blockchains and the terms "source," "destination," and "message."

### Securing Cross-Chain Communication

In this section, we look at techniques to secure cross-chain communication. We dive into signature schemes, multi-signature schemes, and the BLS multi-signature scheme.

### Interchain Messaging

Avalanche blockchains can natively interoperate between one another using ICM. You will learn about the ICM message format and how the message flow works.

### Avalanche Interchain Token Transfer

In this section, we learn what Avalanche Interchain Token Transfer is and what is abstracted away from the general dApp developer. You will also build your first cross-Avalanche L1 dApps.

## Prerequisites

### Avalanche

This course is intended for people with knowledge about Cross-Chain communication protocols, and a solid understanding of the basic concepts of Avalanche. You should be familiar with these concepts:

1. Avalanche Architecture: Be familiar with Avalanche blockchains.
2. Cross-Chain Messages: Know how to communicate 2 Avalanche blockchains with Teleporter. 

If some of this is not clear, we strongly recommend taking the Avalanche Fundamentals, Multi-Chain Architecture, and Interchain Messaging courses first.

### Software Development

You will need a general understanding of Software Development. You won't have to write a lot of code, but you will have to be able to understand some. Therefore, we recommend:

1. Solidity: Basic Knowledge, familiarity with types and interfaces. 
2. Foundry: Familiarity with Foundry will help to deploy and interact with contracts. 

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will:

- Understand what Avalanche Interchain Token Transfer is and when to use it.
- Understand the differents options on how you can transfer assets between multiple chains.
- Apply the knowledge gained in the course by enabiling assets to be transfered between multiple Avalanche blockchains.

We are still working on enabling some features, so in the future you will be able to evaluate your own understanding of the material through quizzes and claim a certificate for successful completion at the end.
