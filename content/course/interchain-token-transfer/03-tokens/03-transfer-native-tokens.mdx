In this exercise, you will learn how to transfer native tokens on your own L1 in the Avalanche network using Foundry, a powerful toolkit for EVM application development. We will use the blockchain you have create in the last chapter.

<Steps>
<Step>

## Create account
```bash
avalanche key create myKey
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Save the Key to an Environment Variable

Retrieve the new address with and store it in an environment variable to match the following commands.
 
```bash
avalanche key list -l --subnets myblockchain --keys myKey
```

```bash
export $MYADDRESS=0x...
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Check the Balance

Now we are checking the balance of that key on 

```bash
cast balance $MYADDRESS --rpc-url myblockchain
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Transfer funds

```bash
cast send $MYKEY --value 200000  --private-key $PK --rpc-url myblockchain
```

</Step>
<Step>

### Check balances to confirm transfer

```bash
cast balance $MYADDRESS --rpc-url myblockchain
```

</Step>
</Steps>

As you saw, funds were transfered from one count to another within the same chain (myblockchain)
