## Bridge the Token Cross-chain

First, get the `Destination Blockchain ID` in hexidecimal format, which in this example is the BlockchainID of your local C-Chain, run:

```zsh
avalanche primary describe
```

`Destination Blockchain ID` is in the field: `BlockchainID (HEX)`.

```bash
export C_CHAIN_BLOCKCHAIN_ID_HEX=0x55e1fcfdde01f9f6d4c16fa2ed89ce65a8669120a86f321eef121891cab61241
```

Now that all the bridge contracts have been deployed, send a native token from your Subnet to C-Chain with the [`cast send`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-send) foundry command.

```zsh
cast send --rpc-url mysubnet --private-key $PK <TokenHomeAddress> \
"<functionToCall((parameterTypes))>" \
"(<functionParameter0>,<functionParameter1>,...)" \
--value <amountOfTokensToSend>
```

In line 60 of [`NativeTokenHome`](./NativeTokenHome.sol) is the send function we will call to send the tokens:

```sol
function send(SendTokensInput calldata input) external payable {
        _send(input, msg.value, false);
    }
```

The function parameters are defined by the `SendTokensInput` struct defined in line 26 of [`ITeleporterTokenBridge`](./interfaces/ITeleporterTokenBridge.sol).

```sol
struct SendTokensInput {
    bytes32 destinationBlockchainID;
    address destinationBridgeAddress;
    address recipient;
    address feeTokenAddress;
    uint256 primaryFee;
    uint256 secondaryFee;
    uint256 requiredGasLimit;
}
```

- destinationBlockchainID: C-Chain Blockchain ID
- destinationBridgeAddress: ERC20 Remote address
- recipient: any Ethereum Address you want to send funds to
- feeTokenAddress: Wrapped Native Token address
- primaryFee: amount of tokens to pay for Teleporter fee on the source chain, can be 0 for this example
- secondaryFee: amount of tokens to pay for Teleporter fee if a multi-hop is needed, can be 0 for this example
- requiredGasLimit: gas limit requirement for sending to a token bridge, can be 1000000 for this example

For example, this token transfer could be entered into your terminal as:

  function sendAndCall(SendAndCallInput calldata input) external payable {
        _sendAndCall({
            sourceBlockchainID: blockchainID,
            originBridgeAddress: address(this),
            originSenderAddress:_msgSender(),
            input: input,
            amount: msg.value,
            isMultiHop: false
        });
    }

struct SendTokensInput {
    bytes32 destinationBlockchainID;
    address destinationBridgeAddress;
    address recipient;
    address primaryFeeTokenAddress;
    uint256 primaryFee;
    uint256 secondaryFee;
    uint256 requiredGasLimit;
    address multiHopFallback;
}

```bash
cast send --rpc-url mysubnet --private-key $PK $ERC20_HOME_BRIDGE_SUBNET "send((bytes32, address, address, address, uint256, uint256, uint256, address))" "(${C_CHAIN_BLOCKCHAIN_ID_HEX}, ${ERC20_TOKEN_REMOTE_C_CHAIN}, ${FUNDED_ADDRESS}, 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000, 0, 0, 250000, 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000)"  --value 1
```

If your parameters were entered correctly, this command will sign and publish a transaction, resulting in a large JSON response of transaction information in the terminal.

To confirm the token was bridged from Subnet to C-Chain, we will check the recipient's balance of wrapped tokens on the C-Chain with the [`cast call`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/cast/cast-call?highlight=cast%20call#cast-call) foundry command:

```zsh
cast call --rpc-url local-c $ERC20_TOKEN_REMOTE_C_CHAIN "balanceOf(address)(uint)" $FUNDED_ADDRESS
```

If the command returns a balance greater than 0, congratulations, you've now successfully deployed a Teleporter-enabled bridge and successfully sent tokens cross-chain!
