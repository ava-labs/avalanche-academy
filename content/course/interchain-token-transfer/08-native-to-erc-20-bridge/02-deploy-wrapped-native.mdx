## Wrapped Native Token

On your Avalanche L1, deploy a wrapped token contract for your native token. When we configured the Avalanche L1 earlier, we named the token `NATV`. This is reflected in line 19 of our [example wrapped token contract](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-interchain-token-transfer/blob/main/contracts/src/WrappedNativeToken.sol).

```
forge create --rpc-url myblockchain --private-key $PK src/5-native-to-erc20-token-bridge/ExampleWNATV.sol:WNATV
```

Export the "Deployed to" address as an environment variables.

```bash
export WRAPPED_ERC20_HOME_SUBNET=<"Deployed to" address>
```

```bash

```

## Native Token Home

To bridge the token out of your Avalanche L1, you'll need to first deploy a _home_ contract on your Avalanche L1 that implements the `INativeTokenBridge` interface, and inherits the properties of the `TeleporterTokenHome` contract standard.

Using the [`forge create`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-create) command, we will deploy the [NativeTokenHome.sol](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-interchain-token-transfer/blob/main/contracts/src/TokenHome/NativeTokenHome.sol) contract, passing in the following constructor arguments:

```bash
forge create --rpc-url myblockchain --private-key $PK lib/teleporter-token-bridge/contracts/src/TokenHome/NativeTokenHome.sol:NativeTokenHome --constructor-args $TELEPORTER_REGISTRY_SUBNET $FUNDED_ADDRESS $WRAPPED_ERC20_HOME_SUBNET
```

- Interchain Messaging Registry (for our Avalanche L1)
- Interchain Messaging Manager (our funded address)
- Wrapped Token Address (deployed in the last step)

For example, this foundry command could be entered into your terminal as:

```bash
forge create --rpc-url myblockchain --private-key $PK src/5-native-token-bridge/NativeTokenHome.sol:NativeTokenHome --constructor-args 0xAd00Ce990172Cfed987B0cECd3eF58221471a0a3 0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC 0x52C84043CD9c865236f11d9Fc9F56aa003c1f922
```

Note the address the home contract was "Deployed to".

```bash 
export ERC20_HOME_BRIDGE_SUBNET=<"Deployed to" address>
```

### ERC20 Remote

To ensure the wrapped token is bridged into the destination chain (in this case, C-Chain) you'll need to deploy a _remote_ contract that implements the `IERC20Bridge` interface, as well as inheriting the properties of `TeleporterTokenRemote`. In order for the bridged tokens to have all the normal functionality of a locally deployed ERC20 token, this remote contract must also inherit the properties of a standard `ERC20` contract.

First, get the `Source Blockchain ID` in hexidecimal format, which in this example is the BlockchainID of your Avalanche L1, run:

```bash
avalanche subnet describe myblockchain
```

```bash
export SUBNET_BLOCKCHAIN_ID_HEX=0x4d569bf60a38e3ab3e92afd016fe37f7060d7d63c44e3378f42775bf82a7642d
```

`Source Blockchain ID` is in the field: `Local Network BlockchainID (HEX)`.

Using the [`forge create`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/reference/forge/forge-create) command, we will deploy the [ERC20RTokenRemote.sol](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-interchain-token-transfer/blob/main/contracts/src/TokenRemote/ERC20TokenRemote.sol) contract, passing in the following constructor arguments:

```bash
forge create --rpc-url local-c --private-key $PK lib/teleporter-token-bridge/contracts/src/TokenRemote/ERC20TokenRemote.sol:ERC20TokenRemote --constructor-args "(${TELEPORTER_REGISTRY_C_CHAIN}, ${FUNDED_ADDRESS}, ${SUBNET_BLOCKCHAIN_ID_HEX}, ${ERC20_HOME_BRIDGE_SUBNET})" "Wrapped NATV" "WNATV" 18
```

- Interchain Messaging Registry Address **(for C-Chain)**
- Interchain Messaging Manager (our funded address)
- Source Blockchain ID (hexidecimal representation of our Avalanche L1's Blockchain ID)
- Token Home Address (address of NativeTokenHome.sol deployed on Avalanche L1 in the last step)
- Token Name (input in the constructor of the [wrapped token contract](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-interchain-token-transfer/blob/main/contracts/src/WrappedNativeToken.sol))
- Token Symbol (input in the constructor of the [wrapped token contract](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-interchain-token-transfer/blob/main/contracts/src/WrappedNativeToken.sol))
- Token Decimals (uint8 integer representing number of decimal places for the ERC20 token being created. Most ERC20 tokens follow the Ethereum standard, which defines 18 decimal places.)

For example, this contract deployment could be entered into your terminal as:

```bash
forge create --rpc-url local-c --private-key $PK \
lib/teleporter-token-bridge/contracts/src/TokenRemote/ERC20TokenRemote.sol:ERC20TokenRemote \
--constructor-args 0xAd00Ce990172Cfed987B0cECd3eF58221471a0a3 \
0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC \
0xbcb8143686b1f0c765a1404bb94ad13134cafa5cf56f181a3a990ba21b1151b9 \
0x17aB05351fC94a1a67Bf3f56DdbB941aE6c63E25 \
"Wrapped NATV" \
"WNATV" \
18
```

Note the address the remote contract was "Deployed to".

```bash
export ERC20_TOKEN_REMOTE_C_CHAIN=<"Deployed to" address>
```

## Register Remote Bridge with Home Bridge

After deploying the bridge contracts, you'll need to register the remote bridge by sending a dummy message using the `registerWithHome` method. This message includes details which inform the home bridge about your destination blockchain and bridge settings, eg. `initialReserveImbalance`.

```bash
cast send --rpc-url local-c --private-key $PK $ERC20_TOKEN_REMOTE_C_CHAIN "registerWithHome((address, uint256))" "(0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000, 0)"
```
