## Bridge a Avalanche L1's Native Token to the C-Chain

The following code example will show you how to send a Avalanche L1's native token to the C-Chain using Interchain Messaging and Foundry. This demo is conducted on a local network run by the CLI, but can be applied to Fuji Testnet and Avalanche Mainnet directly.

**All token bridge contracts and interfaces implemented in this example implementation are maintained in the [teleporter-token-bridge](https://github.com/ava-labs/teleporter-token-bridge/tree/main/contracts/src) repository.**

If you prefer full end-to-end testing written in Golang for bridging ERC20s, native tokens, or any combination of the two, you can view the test workflows directly in the [teleporter-token-bridge](https://github.com/ava-labs/teleporter-token-bridge/tree/main/tests/flows) repository.

Deep dives on each template interface can be found [here](https://github.com/ava-labs/teleporter-token-bridge/blob/main/contracts/README.md).

_Disclaimer: The teleporter-token-bridge contracts used in this tutorial are under active development and are not yet intended for production deployments. Use at your own risk._

## What we have to do

1. Create an Avalanche L1 and Deploy on Local Network
2. Deploy Wrapped Native Token C-chain
3. Deploy the Interchain Token Transferer Contracts on C-chain and Avalanche L1
4. Register Remote Token with Home Transferer
5. Add Collateral and Start Sending Tokens

## Parameter Management

As you deploy the teleporter contracts, keeping track of their addresses will make testing and troubleshooting much easier. The parameters you should keep track of include:

| Parameter                     | Network | Description                                                                                                                                         |
| :---------------------------- | :------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Funded Address (with 1000000) | Both    | The public address you use to deploy contracts, and send tokens through the bridge. Used as the `teleporterManager` constructor parameter in this example. |
| Interchain Messaging Registry           | C-Chain | Address of the TeleporterRegistry contract on C-Chain deployed by the CLI                                                                           |
| Interchain Messaging Registry           | Avalanche L1  | Address of the TeleporterRegistry contract on Avalanche L1 deployed by the CLI                                                                            |
| Wrapped Native Token          | Avalanche L1  | Address of the wrapped token contract for your Avalanche L1's native token to be deployed on the Avalanche L1                                                   |
| Native Token Home           | Avalanche L1  | Address of the bridge's Home contract to be deployed on the Avalanche L1                                                                                |
| ERC20 Remote            | C-Chain | Address of the bridge's remote contract to be deployed on the C-Chain                                                                          |
| Avalanche L1 Blockchain ID          | Avalanche L1  | Hexadecimal representation of the Avalanche L1's Blockchain ID. Returned by `avalanche subnet describe <subnetName>`.                                     |
| C-Chain Blockchain ID         | C-Chain | Hexadecimal representation of the C-Chain's Blockchain ID on the selected network. Returned by `avalanche primary describe`.                        |
