As a segue to learning about the object-oriented programming aspect of Solidity, we will touch upon contract constructors. Similar to class constructors in other languages, constructors in Solidity allow us to define the state of a contract at the time of initialization.
Syntax
Below is the general syntax for a contract constructor:
constructor(<arguments>) {
         
}
Example
Below is an example of a contract constructor in action:
contract A {
    uint num;
  
    constructor(uint _num) {
        num = _num;
    }
}
