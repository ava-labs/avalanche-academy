A Subnet is a sovereign network defining its own rules of its membership and token economics. It’s composed of a dynamic subset of Avalanche validators working together to achieve consensus on the state of one or more blockchains. Each blockchain is validated by exactly one Subnet, and a Subnet can have many blockchains. A validator may be a member of many Subnets.

Avalanche's three main blockchains: the Platform Chain (P-Chain), Contract Chain (C-Chain), and Exchange Chain (X-Chain) are validated and secured by all the Avalanche validators, which compose a special Subnet: the Primary Network.

By definition, all Subnet validators must also validate the Avalanche Primary Network.

Subnets are independent. They specify their own execution logic, determine their own fee regime, maintain their own state, facilitate their own networking, and provide their own security. They don’t share execution thread, storage ,or networking with other Subnets, including the Primary Network, effectively allowing the Avalanche network to scale up easily while enabling lower latency, higher transactions per second (TPS), and lower transaction costs.
