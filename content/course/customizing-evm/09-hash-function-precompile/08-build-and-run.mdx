## Build Your Custom VM

There's a simple build script in the Precompile-EVM we can utilize to build. First, make sure you are in the root folder of you Precompile-EVM:

```bash
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ava-labs/precompile-evm
```

Then run the command to initiate the build script:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
```

If you do not see any error, the build was successful.

## Run a Local Network with Your Custom VM

First, make sure the gRPC of the Avalanche Network Runner is running. If not, start it with:

```bash
avalanche-network-runner server \
--log-level debug \
--port=":8080" \
--grpc-gateway-port=":8081"
```

<Accordion title="Troubleshooting Error: `listen tcp :8080: bind: address already in use'">

If the above command fails with the error: "listen tcp :8080: bind: address already in use", then your server is probably still running from the previous exercise.

To see what is running on port 8080 run the following command: `sudo lsof -i tcp:8080`

You can kill the process by using the PID stated in the earlier output: `sudo kill -9 <PID here>`

Now run the command above again and everything should work as expected.

If it wasn't running, start a network with the blockchain spec like we did in the [previous chapter](./content/course/customizing-evm/07-your-evm-blockchain/02-create-your-blockchain.mdx).

If it was still running, we do not need to call the `control start` command, but can simply add a new blockchain to the already running local network using the HTTP Client. Don't forget to add the path to your new `md5.json` genesis file.

Alternatively, you can also open a new terminal and issue the following command to create the new blockchain:

```bash
avalanche-network-runner control create-blockchains '[{"vm_name":"subnetevm","genesis":"tests/precompile/genesis/sha256.json"}]'
```
