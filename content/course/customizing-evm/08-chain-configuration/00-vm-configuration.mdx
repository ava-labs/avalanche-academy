In this part of our course, we will look at optimizing your EVM for specific use cases via the chain configuration. Tailoring EVM configurations to fit specific use cases is one of the key advantages of multi-chain systems.

## Exercise

In this section, we do not need to write any Go code. We simply change values of the json file of the genesis block.

## Structure of this Section

We will cover the following topics:

- Genesis Block: The cornerstone of any blockchain. We'll provide an overview of its components and how its properties can be customized.
- Fee Configuration: How to strike a balance between incentivizing validators and ensuring economic feasibility for users. This aspect i vital in a public network where the goal is to manage congestion and discourage wasteful transactions.
- Initial Token Allocation: How you can specify the initial distribution of tokens in your custom EVM, setting your network up for success.
- Preinstalled Precompiles: By adding configurations for preinstalled precompiles, you can use powerful precompiles that do many things, such as restricting who can issue transactions or deploy contracts to your chain.

Finally, we'll demonstrate how to run a local EVM with a custom Genesis Block. This  exercise will enable you to consolidate your learnings and appreciate the impact of customizations on EVM performance first-hand.

## Learning Objective

By the end of this section, you will be able to customize the EVM in Avalanche effectively, opening doors to a range of possibilities for your blockchain projects. Let's dive into this intriguing world of EVM customization and chain configuration together!
