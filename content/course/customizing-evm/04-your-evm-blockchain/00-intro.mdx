In this part of our course, we'll look at running your own Avalanche Network with your own EVM. The ability to run your own EVM enables us to cater to specific use cases and is one of the key advantages of multi-chain systems over monolithic systems.

## Hands-On Exercise

In this section, we do not need to write a single line of Go code. We simply run some commands to spin up our EVM blockchain.

## Structure of this Section

We will cover the following topics in this section:

- Avalanche CLI: This tool enables us to spin up our own Avalanche Network and add Avalanche L1s and Blockchains to it.
- Token Transfer: Learn how to make a token transfer with foundry

This practical exercise will let you consolidate your learnings and appreciate the impact of customizations on EVM performance first-hand.

## Learning Objective

By the end of this section, you will have the skills to run your own Avalanche Network with your own EVM blockchain effectively, opening new doors for your blockchain projects.
