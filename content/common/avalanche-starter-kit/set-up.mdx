The Avalanche Starter Kit contains everything you need to get started quickly with Avalanche. Among other tools it contains Avalanche CLI. With that you can set up a local network, create a Subnet, customize the Subnet/VM configuration, and so on. 

In this course we will run the Avalanche Starter Kit in a hosted environment on Github. This is the most quick way to get started.

# Start Avalanche Starter Kit in a Codespace

Follow the steps in the following video:

PLACEHOLDER: [Video: Start Avalanche Starter Kit in a Codespace]


<Link
    href="https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanche-starter-kit"
    className={cn(
    buttonVariants({ variant: 'default', className: 'mt-4' }),
    )}
>Open Avalanche Starter Kit</Link>

- Open the Avalanche Starter Kit Github Repository
- Click the green **Code** button
- Switch to the **Codespaces* tab
- Click **Create Codespace on main**

The Codespace will open in a new tab. Wait until it's fully built

# Verify everything is working correctly

Open the terminal with `` Ctrl + ` `` or by opening it through the menu:

Now enter avalanche -h to verify everything is working:

```bash
avalanche -h
```

As a result you should see the help of Avalanche CLI:

```
Avalanche-CLI is a command-line tool that gives developers access to
everything Avalanche. This release specializes in helping developers
build and test Subnets.
