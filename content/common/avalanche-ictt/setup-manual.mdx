## Local Network Environment

For convenience the private key `56289e99c94b6912bfc12adc093c9b51124f0dc54ac7a766b2bc5ccf558d8027` of the default airdrop address is stored in the environment variable `$PK` in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` of the Starter-kit. Furthermore, the RPC url for the C-Chain `local-c` and the Avalanche L1 with the name `myblockchain` on the local network is set in the `foundry.toml` file.

### Avalanche L1 Configuration and Deployment

To get started, create an Avalanche L1 configuration named "myblockchain":

```bash
avalanche blockchain create myblockchain
```

Your Avalanche L1 should have the following things:

- Interchain Messaging enabled
- CLI should run an AWM Relayer
- Upon Avalanche L1 deployment, 100 tokens should be airdropped to the default ewoq address (0x8db97C7cEcE249c2b98bDC0226Cc4C2A57BF52FC)
- Native Minter Precompile enabled with either your admin address or the pre-computed Remote token address

_Note: If you have created your Avalanche L1 using AvaCloud, you can add Remote Token address [using the dashboard](https://support.avacloud.io/avacloud-how-do-i-use-the-native-token-minter)._

```bash
✔ Avalanche L1-EVM
✔ Use latest release version
✔ Yes
✔ Yes

Enter your subnet's ChainId. It can be any positive integer.
ChainId: 123
Select a symbol for your subnet's native token
Token symbol: NAT
✔ Low disk use    / Low Throughput    1.5 mil gas/s (C-Chain's setting)
✔ Customize your airdrop

✔ Native Minting
✔ Add

✔ Done
✔ Done
✔ Done
✔ No
✓ Successfully created subnet configuration
```

Finally, deploy your Avalanche L1:

```bash
avalanche blockchain deploy myblockchain
```

```bash
? Choose a network for the operation:
✔ Local Network
Deploying [myblockchain] to Local Network
```

The CLI will output addresses and information that will be important for the rest of the tutorial:

```bash

```

From this output, take note of the following parameters

- Funded Address (with 100 tokens),
- Interchain Messaging Registry on C-chain, and
- Interchain Messaging Registry on Avalanche L1

Set these parameters as environment variables so that we can manage them easily and also use them in the commands later.

```bash
export FUNDED_ADDRESS=<Funded Address (with 100 tokens)>
export TELEPORTER_REGISTRY_C_CHAIN=<Interchain Messaging Registry on C-chain>
export TELEPORTER_REGISTRY_SUBNET=<Interchain Messaging Registry on Avalanche L1>
```
